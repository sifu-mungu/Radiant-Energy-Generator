Comprehensive Build Guide: Radiant Energy + Resonant Conversion Device

---

I. INTRODUCTION: UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF FUNCTION

This device works by capturing and transforming energy that exists all around us in the atmosphere and electromagnetic environment. It is based on two primary concepts:

1. Radiant Energy Collection – The system collects high-voltage ambient or atmospheric potential between the sky (via a raised metal plate) and the Earth (via a ground rod). This acts like a massive natural capacitor, and the energy is stored in high-voltage capacitors.

2. High-Frequency Resonance and Energy Transformation – That stored energy is then released in fast pulses through a spark gap and Tesla coil, which converts it into a form that can be stepped up, rectified, and harvested.

T. Henry Moray's original device appeared to harness this ambient potential using specially designed cold cathode “valves” that allowed energy to flow in without conventional current conduction. This guide includes a version of that principle.
